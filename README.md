# Javascript month - 60projects 30days
 This is a repo for new Javascript developers, used by many budding programmers, myself included, to get your feet wet with some vanilla JS. After these challenges, you'll feel more confident in your skills and you'll be able to tackle more advanced challenges. Credit to Brad Traversy for designing this helpful course.
